# Issue Management Policies

This is a brief summary of some of the policies we have in place to assist us in managing issues and the justification for them so that we can continue delivering value.

## Commenting on closed issues

In general, we recommend you open a new issue if you have a bug, feature request, or question to discuss. If you find a closed issue that is related, open a *new issue* and link to the closed issue rather than posting on the closed issue. A new issue will get more attention from the team.

## Needs Author Feedback

If a contributor reviews an issue and determines that more information is needed from the author, they will post a comment requesting that information and apply the `Feedback-Need more info` label. This label indicates that the author needs to post a response in order for us to continue investigating the issue.

## Duplicate issues

If we determine that the issue is a duplicate of another, we will label it with the `Resolution-Duplicate` label. 

## Answered questions

If we determine that the issue is a question and have posted an answer, we will label it with the `Resolution-Answered` label.

## Inactivity

After an issue has had no activity for **90 days** it will be automatically be marked as inactive, if no activity occurs for a further 10 days the issue will be closed. This is done in order to reduce noise and prioritize important features and bugs. 

If you are still encountering the problem reported in an issue, or have a related question or bug report, feel free to open a *new issue* and link to the original issue!
